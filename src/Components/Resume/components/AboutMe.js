        I am a fresher frontend developer passionate about creating
        user-friendly web interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am eager
        to apply my skills and learn new technologies in real-world projects. In
        addition to my frontend expertise, I am currently a beginner at Spring
        Boot and have a foundational understanding of its core concepts. I am
        enthusiastic about expanding my knowledge in backend development and
        integrating it with my frontend skills to build comprehensive web
        applications.
